- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `.next`

#### Additional Steps to Take on Netlify
- Add Environmental Variables
    - Any Enviromental variables you are using in your `.env` file should be added to Netlify. 
        - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment > Environment variables and the keys and values there.
